Troll toolkit is a very useful tool kit used for immense trolling on discord

# Install

Prerequisites

    ```

# How to use it?
I DO NOT CONDONE ANY USE OF THIS TOOLKIT AGAINST THE [DISCORD TOS](https://discord.com/terms)

Basic usage:
 - First you need to setup the bots. The best thing to do is add tokens in config.troll
 - After you are in the web interface, go to the Bots tab
 - Click Add Bots (not the one with the token input)
 - Now, go to the server tab and add the Guild ID into the input and set the server
 - You are now free to go and do a little trolling! (within the confines of the [discord tos](https://discord.com/terms))
